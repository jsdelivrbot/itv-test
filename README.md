# Front End Task
A small assignment
If you've been sent this link then we would like to better understand how you work, and to do this we'd like you to undertake a small assignment.

At Potato, we use a variety of front end technologies to develop rich and responsive interfaces and have developed an assignment to help us assess a candidate's abilities in this broad discipline.

The task is to consume a public [JSON API Feed] (https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=potato&tagmode=all&format=json) [(documentation)](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) and display the resulting data according to these [annotated wireframes](https://p.ota.to/static/download/FE-Dev-Task-Wires.zip).

It should only take a few hours and there's no deadline. You won't be judged on the completion time, so there's no rush, just let us know once it's completed.

The website should function as a one-page app
Layout should match the provided wireframes
Look and feel is up to you, flat colours for borders and background are all that's expected
Supports the same set of browsers as Google Apps [(supported browsers list)](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33864)
Site should use responsive techniques to ensure it works on a range of devices
Must be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript (SCSS or Less are encouraged)
We encourage the use of AngularJS, Angular 2+ or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for your module/application
Use any 3rd party libs you like (as long as they have a weak copyleft license)
We understand your time is precious, but if you do feel like going that extra mile then we've included a few optional enhancements below which you might like to consider. Or perhaps you may want to simply spec out one or two of these features for us, rather than actually implementing them.

Search items e.g. a free-text search box where text entered is matched against tags
Infinite scrolling or "Load more" style pagination
[Google +1](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/+1/) button for results
Build process for generating production-ready code
Tests (unit tests, e2e tests, etc)
Also, feel free to include any other features that you think the app could benefit from.

We'd like to see how you write code so try to keep it simple, but don't be afraid to add some flair to show off what you can do. Ideally you would upload your repository (to GitHub or similar) so that we can have a poke around.

We're looking forward to seeing what you produce! Thanks for your time.
